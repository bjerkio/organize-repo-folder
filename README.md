# Organize Repo Folder

This utility is written in Go and features a simple script to organize your local repositories according to this opinionated structure (brutally):

```shell
Repos
├── bjerkio
│   ├── jobs
│   ├── oidc-react
│   ├── pulumi-appsync-modules
│   └── vault-action
├── cobraz
│   ├── firestore-graphql-scalars
│   ├── norwegian-ssn-graphql-scalar
│   ├── organize-repo-folder
│   └── pulumi-action
└── sindresorhus
    ├── awesome
    ├── awesome-nodejs
    └── gifski
```

In the example above, `bjerkio`, `cobraz` and `sindresorhus` are organizations or GitHub users. The scripts get this from the git source (ex. `git@github.com:*cobraz*/organize-repo-folder.git`). Please note, we are lowercasing both the organization name and repository name. Repositories that either has no origin source have a non-standard GitHub path or maybe having issues are parsed by Git, will be kept in a backup directory.

## Warning

This command-line utility is very bare-bone. You should make sure that you have a backup of everything. Remember that probably all your repositories will get a new location, so – that
could cause problems for running applications and editors. You probably want to close them before running any of this.

Also, as we are creating a `(name of your repository-folder)-bak` of your old folder and consequently moving all your repositories over to a new folder, you could risk losing stuff if the `-bak` folder is there before running.

Lastly, we do not confirm anything. Once you run the command – here be dragons!

## Install

brew install cobraz/tools/organize-repo-folder
